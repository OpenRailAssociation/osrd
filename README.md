## What is OSRD?

OSRD is a work in progress tool meant to help design and operate railway infrastructure.
It's built around a simulator, which evaluates a timetable on a given infrastructure.

It's free and open-source forever!

## WARNING

OSRD is still in the early stages of development.
APIs can and will change (now is the time to make suggestions!).
Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse.
Please don't build any serious projects with OSRD unless you are prepared to be broken by API changes.

## Getting Started

You'll need:
 - Docker
 - Docker Compose

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Contributing

If you think OSRD doesn't quite fit your needs yet, but still believe it could,
please [tell us about your needs](https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/issues/new).

Please consider committing resources to help development if you'd like to use OSRD in production.
Code contributions are very welcome, and we'd love to work together to make this project better.

## Thanks

We would like to thank:

 - Bj√∏rnar Steinnes Luteberget, who wrote a very interesting thesis on the matter,
   as well as a [pretty impressive prototype](https://github.com/luteberget/junction)
