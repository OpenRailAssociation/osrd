## Design Goals

- **Microscopic**: The movement of trains should be accurately simulated, as well as their interactions with interlocking / signaling
- **Readable**: The code must be kept to very high quality standards, so everyone can contribute
- **Modular**: Users should be able to easily integrate their own hardware and behaviors
- **Observable**: What happens in the simulation must be easy to monitor
- **Fast**: Simulating a full day of operation for 500+ trains shouldn't take hours

Many of these goals currently aren't _yet_ fulfilled: the simulation is pretty slow, and the feature set is very limited.

## Simulation roadmap

- [x] Reasonably accurate simulation of train movement
- [x] Import of railML3 infrastructure
- [x] Static speed restrictions
- [x] Full history of internal simulation events
- [x] Basic interlocking / signaling support
- [x] Make the train react to signals
- [x] pathfinding in the route graph
- [x] API server mode
- [ ] ERTMS support
- [ ] Parallel integration of train movement
- [x] Variable step integration
- [ ] Driver behavior model
- [ ] ~~Rewrite everything in Rust~~

## Getting Started

You'll need:

- Java 17
- Python >= 3.9 (For generating example / test files)
- Install the `python/railjson_generator` library using poetry:
  ```sh
  poetry --directory=../python/railjson_generator install
  ```

### Server usage (preferred)

```sh
# on Linux / MacOS
./gradlew processTestResources shadowJar

# on Windows
gradlew.bat processTestResources shadowJar

# Run as service
java -jar build/libs/osrd-all.jar api --url http://localhost:8090/ -p 8080

# Check that an infra can be loaded
java -jar build/libs/osrd-all.jar load-infra --path RAILJSON_INFRA
```

### CLI usage (alternative)

```sh
# on Linux / MacOS
./gradlew processTestResources shadowJar

# on Windows
gradlew.bat processTestResources shadowJar

# Run a simulation. You can use the files generated by the previous command
# in ./build/generated_examples/small_infra for an example of the formats used.
java -jar build/libs/osrd-all.jar standalone-simulation --infra_path example/infra.json \
      --sim_path example/simulation.json --res_path example/results.json
```
