This folder contains two configurations:

 - `config_railml.json` uses the hand-written `infra.xml` RailML infrastructure file
 - `config_railjson.json` uses a RailJSON infrastructure converted from RailML. Signals were manually added.
 
As RailML doesn't yet have a well-defined signaling system for simulation, only `config_railjson.json` is usable.
