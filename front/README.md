# OSRD's Front

[![Front](https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/actions/workflows/front.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/actions/workflows/front.yml)

## How to launch project for developpement purpose ?

- go inside `/front/` from OSRD main project
- exec `yarn` (hope you have a good connexion and a good cup of tea)
- exec `yarn start` (perhaps you'll need `NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"` if your node
  version is too new)
- enjoy

## Commands

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in a local development environment.

This requires the other services (api, core, postgresâ€¦) to be running in your local environment as
well.

See [Main Readme](../README.md) if you need more information to run the docker.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `yarn generate-licenses`

Update licenses attributions in /src/common/ReleaseInformations/json/

### `yarn e2e-tests`

Launches end to end tests.

It requires:
- Backend containers to be up: `docker compose build core redis api editoast postgres`
- Running front
- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to be installed

This command will execute all tests defined. The command can be changed in [`test_e2e.py`](../tests/tests/test_e2e.py) to execute only one test with or without debug mode.
`test_e2e.py` is executing [playwright command](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) in a python subprocess. Example of modification to apply to launch only `stdcm-page.spec.ts` in debug mode with chromium:

```diff
    result = subprocess.run(
        [
            "yarn",
            "--cwd",
            "front",
            "playwright",
            "test"
+           "stdcm-page.spec.ts",
            "--reporter=line",
+           "--debug",
+           "--project=chromium"
        ],
        cwd=Path(__file__).parents[2],
        check=False,
    )
```

## Design rules

OSRD's front is based upon [SNCF Bootstrap](https://designmetier-bootstrap.sncf.fr/). It aims to
follow SNCF's design system guidelines, although the style has deviated quite a bit due to
components requiring a specific design.

## Homepage `/src/main`

Landing is done in `/main` where we can find `app.js` for routing purpose and `home.js` as homepage
with cards linking to differents applications.

OSRD's front is organized in 5 main `applications/`.

## Applications `/src/applications`

All applications are contained in a single folder, have a `home` JS/TS file and views & components
organized in folders.

**The components propose the main JS/TS file and eventually another folder with same name containing
some minors subcomponents linked to.**

- [customget/](#isolated-space-time-chart-for-research-needs-customget)
  - components/
  - views/
- [editor/](#infrastructure-editor-editor)
  - components/
- [opendata/](#opendata-importation-opendata)
  - components/
  - views/
- [operationalStudies/](#operational-studies-operationalstudies)
  - components/
  - views/
- [referenceMap/](#reference-map-referencemap)
- [stdcm/](#short-term-dcm-stdcm)
  - views/

### Operational Studies `operationalStudies/`

The operational studies application enables capacity studies to be carried out on a given
infrastructure.

#### Folder's tree

- **components/**
  - **Helpers/**
  - **ManageTrainSchedule/**
  - **Project/**
  - **Scenario/**
  - **SimulationResults/**
  - **Study/**
- consts.ts
- Home.tsx
- **views/**
  - ManageTrainSchedule.jsx
  - Project.js
  - Scenario.js
  - SimulationResults.tsx
  - Study.js

The functional workflow works as follows:

- create a project `applications/operationalStudies/Home.js`
- create a study in this project `applications/operationalStudies/views/Project.js`
- choose an infrastructure to create a scenario in the study
  `applications/operationalStudies/views/Study.js`

Once in a scenario `applications/operationalStudies/views/Scenario.js` you have to add trains in the
timetable `applications/operationalStudies/views/ManageTrainSchedule.jsx`. To do so:

- choose an infrastructure & timetable _DEPRECATED: will be removed soon_
- choose a rolling stock `common/rollingStockSelector` and a composition code
- define a path on the map with crossing points (the path takes into account the restrictions of the
  material and the infrastructure)
- determine possible margins
- choose the number of trains to add

Then, the simulation results `applications/operationalStudies/SimulationResults` appear as (top to
bottom):

- The details of the current train and a module for controlling the time cursor
- A fixed width timeline to explore the whole study
- A space-time graph displaying all the trains projected on a given path
- The space-speed graph of the selected train
- The graph of curves and gradients of the selected train
- The train sheet of the selected train
- The map showing the route, the position of the trains in time and space, and the status of the
  signaling with the current block occupation

### Short-term DCM `stdcm/`

STDCM makes it possible to find paths through the residual capacity of a timetable, without
conflicts.

### Infrastructure editor `editor/`

OSRD's infrastructure editor allows you to edit the linear and point objects of a given
infrastructure, and then run simulations based on this information. It is possible to modify the
existing infrastructure as well as to create a new one.

### Opendata importation `opendata/`

_EXPERIMENTATION_ This application uses opendata from [GRAOU](https://carto.graou.info) to create
realistic timetable from [french GTFS data by SNCF](https://data.sncf.com).

### Reference map `referenceMap/`

This is an implementation reference for all map concerns. It aims to display all layers and propose
a ready-to-use map component reference. When adding a new common layer inside an application map
component, please add it first to this application.

### Isolated space-time chart for research needs `customGET/`

_EXPERIMENTATION_ This application, which is not intended to remain as is, is a space-time graph fed
by external data, to be used for thesis work on optimization.

## Common components `/src/common`

All common code (and shared components) supposed to be in `common/`.

## CSS `/src/styles`

## Translation `/public/locales`

# Other

## Coding style Policy

### Javascript / Javascript-React

- ESLint is used as linter and prettier as formatter. Both are configured as devDependencies to
  enforce default eslint configuration eventually overidden by
  [airbnb rules](https://https://airbnb.io/javascript/) translation. A few rules (see eslintrc) has
  been disabled and will be re-enabled in the near future):
  - 'no-named-as-default': 'off',
  - 'react/jsx-props-no-spreading': 0,
  - 'react/static-property-placement': 0,
  - 'import/no-extraneous-dependencies': 0,
- eslint rules incompatible with prettier usage are disabled, yet these styling errors will be
  displayed as prettier issues.
- Do not set your IDE to auto format with current prettier rules for now, as some old files will be
  widely updated and less readable for reviewers.
- Please push commits exclusively dedicated to styling issues
- _For VSCode Users_: Install
  [Prettier - Code Formatter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  and follow instructions.
