# RAILJSON GENERATOR

## How to use

### Functions
- `Infra(lengths)`: build an empty infrastructure whose tracks' lengths are given in `lengths`. The track are indexed from 0 to `nb_tracks - 1` in the same order that they are given in `lengths`

- `Infra.add_link(first, second)`: add an undirected edge between to tracks given their indexes

- `Infra.add_switch(base, left, right)`: build a switch given three tracks indexes. The base track should be the first parameter

- `Simulation(infra)`: build an empty simulation from and infrastructure

- `Simulation.add_schedule(departure_time, departure_track, arrival_track)`: add a train which leaves at departure_time from the middle of departure_track and goes to arrival_track

- `Succession()`: build an empty train succession table

- `Succession.add_table(base, left, right, list_of_trains)`: add a succession table from a list of trains given by their index to the switch `(base, left, right)` of the infrastructure

### Some important rules
- no track can be isolated: a track should appear **at least one time** as argument of `add_link` or `add_switch`
- each track has only two ends: a track should appear **at most two times** as argument of `add_link`or `add_switch`
- each switch must have **one and only one** succession table even if it is left empty

### Example

```
import os, sys, inspect
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe())))
parent_dir = os.path.dirname(current_dir)
sys.path.insert(0, parent_dir)
import generator_infra.libgen as gen

# build the network
infra = gen.Infra([1000] * 7)
infra.add_link(0, 1)
infra.add_link(1, 2)
infra.add_link(2, 3)
infra.add_switch(3, 4, 5)
infra.add_link(4, 6)

# build the trains
sim = gen.Simulation(infra)
sim.add_schedule(0, 0, 6)

# build the successions
succession = gen.Succession()
succession.add_table(2, 0, 1, [2, 0, 1])
succession.add_table(2, 3, 6, [2, 0, 1])
succession.add_table(3, 4, 5, [0, 1])

gen.write_json("config.json", gen.CONFIG_JSON)
gen.write_json("infra.json", infra.to_json())
gen.write_json("simulation.json", sim.to_json())
gen.write_json("succession.json", succession.to_json())
```

generates the infrastructure below

## How it works

### Graph theory

Tracks are nodes that can be connected by two types of links
- link: a bidirectionnal edge between the two tracks
- switche: a triple (base, left, right) of tracks that creates two bidirectionnal edge: {base, left}, {base, right}

### Detectors, TVD sections, routes

#### Detectors
Each track can has two detectors at its ends, either buffer stops or TDE detectors according to how many tracks it is linked

- a track with one buffer stop `#` and a TDE detector `o`:
```
#------------o--+
```
- a track with two TDE detectors `o`
```
+--o---------o--+
```

#### TVD sections

A TVD section is a part of the network delimited by detectors. There are three type of TVD sections

- track: the part of the track between its two detectors
```
o---------o
```
- link: the part of two tracks linked together that is between the detectors
```
o--+--o
```
- switch: the part of the tracks delimited by the three detectors of a switch
```
     o
    /
o--+
    \
     o
```

#### routes
A route is a oriented path between two consecutive detectors and thus occupy only one TVD section

### Signals
Each entreance of a TVD section should be protected by a signal place before this entreance (= the detector)

- a `bal3_line_signal` is placed before the entreance detector of a linear TVD section (track or link type) whose other detector is not a buffer_stop, or before the entreance of a left/right detector of a switch TVD section
```
    >         >
--+--o---------o--+--o--

     v/
     o
    /
o--+
    \
     o
      \^
```
- a `check_route` is placed before the entreance detector of a linear TVD section whose other type is a buffer_stop
```
              <
#--o---------o--+
```
- a `switch_signal` is placed before the entreance of the base detector of a switch TVD section
```
        /
       o
      /
--o--+
 »    \
       o
        \
```


Notation on schemas (oriented from left to right) :
- `>` for a `bal3_line_signal`/`check_route detector`
- `»` for a `switch_signal`

### Schedules

A train schedule is mainly a path of routes which are pairs of detectors. It is computed in the infrastructure with a shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra). The train start at the middle of a track section and ends at the middle of another track section.
